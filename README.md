# Lending Club Case Study
> The case study is an attempt using EDA to identify the driving variables which are strong indicators of applicants to be a Loan Default.


## Business Understanding
We are working for Lending club a finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision: 
	•If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not 	approving the loan results in a loss of business to the 	company 
	•If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she 	is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a 	financial loss for the company.

## Analysis
> 1. Univariate Analysis: 
1. Run through each categorical and continuous variable to analyse the impact to Default count with respect to overall loan status 
2. Select the influential variable based on the positive/negative relation to the Default status 
3. Select the variable infer loan characteristic and help in identifying the default 
> 2. Bivariate Analysis :
1. Influenced Univariate Variables are combined in to two Variable feature set and analyse the Default count 
2. Compared the Binning Discrete Categorical Variable to the actual Categorical Variable to do segmented analysis to see the relation and pattern towards Loan Default 
3. Compared the actual continuous variable to the actual categorical variable to analyse the spread of the data 
4. Combinations of Variables are identified by applying the analytical sense and had business relations

-Applicant’s address state (NV, SD, AK, FL, etc.) 
-Loan issue month (Dec, May, Sep)
